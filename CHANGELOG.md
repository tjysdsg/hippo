## Notice for beta testing users

- All previous user names and passwords are preserved, but please send me your current active
  account (the user name). You can still use your old and inactive account (if any),
  but please don't, as it will complicate our data collections process.
- If there's a new version of the client, an message will be sent to your email (the one you used
  to register the AppCenter account). To update the client, simply click the link in the email and
  follow the instruction.
- If there's any issue or question, please feel free to notify me in the wechat group or send me
  an email at Jiyang.Tang@dukekunshan.edu.cn
