# 1.0.0

## Update Oct 5th 2021

Due to DKU policies, the backend server is migrated to a Duke server. However, Duke OIT requires
that the IP used for extranet and intranet access is different. Basically it means we now have
two separate ways for the client to load the data depending on whether if you are on campus.

Therefore, this update added a switch for you to specify whether if you are on campus.
By default, the switch is set to on campus.

**If you are on campus, the switch must be ON, otherwise you won't be able to load
anything. Similarly, if you are NOT on campus, the switch must be OFF.

**Notice for beta testers**

Hi, I'm Jiyang Tang, a DKU senior and the developer of this app. Thanks for testing this app!

Check out the app instructions here: https://duke.box.com/s/d5xjofqycjyn25zfonshcts9s60gupha

For Android users
- use this link to download and install the app:
  https://install.appcenter.ms/users/tjysdsg/apps/hippo-1/distribution_groups/testers
- You will be required to register an Microsoft AppCenter account, preferably using your duke or dku
  email address.
- You can ask for an apk file in the wechat group and install it manually if the above failed. However,
  doing this makes the update process more complicated.

For iOS users:
- Use this link: https://testflight.apple.com/join/FHOWS4UJ
  It will ask you to download TestFlight and install the app there.
- Account registration is not working (login works). Since I currently don't have my iOS device, I cannot debug this issue
  until September 20. Therefore, please send me your intended username and password privately. Use something
  other than your usual password if you don't trust me XD.

Other notable things
- Skip Two-Syllable Tone Combinations Practice 1 and 2, start your practice from Lesson 01 Dialogue 1
- If you have already an account, previous usernames and passwords are preserved.
- If there's an update the Android client, an message will be sent to your email. To update the client, simply click the link in the email and
  follow the instruction. For iOS client updates, install updates using TestFlight .
- If there's any issue or question, please feel free to notify me in the wechat group or send me
  an email at Jiyang.Tang@dukekunshan.edu.cn (I am in Beijing time zone, and I check wechat more
  often than emails)
